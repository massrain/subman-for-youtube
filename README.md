# YTSubsManager

Youtube currently shows you your entire subscription list. For more active users on the platform; it becomes a hell to remember your favourite channels to watch. 

With YTSubsManager, you can manage your Youtube subscriptions in a folderview. In future versions planned; you will be able to view last videos from those channels in new tabs.
